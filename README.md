# Cloud Based Neural Net Inference
Part of the ACDC Research Project at RWTH Aachen University.

## Abstract: 

Automated Vehicles have, since their inception, used Neural Networks to process the incoming image data captured by the cameras and  other sensors. These are then used to produce actionable results like steering or maneuvering around obstacles. However, with applications like segmentation, and object detection/tracking, neural networks are extremely time-consuming to work with. This can especially be an issue if they need to work on the sensor data at near real time with lowest possible latencies. Such tight constraints pose a significant barrier to AV tech development.On the other hand, with the advent of 5G and other developments in communication technologies, we can expect a significant increase in bandwith with low latencies in the future.Our project aims to leverage the developments in communication technologies to tackle the constraints on sensor data processing. Our proposal involves using a cloud server to take the sensor data from the vehicle cameras. These would get processed by the cloud server computer, with the outputs sent back to the vehicle server. This would be very beneficial as the cloud server will not be as constrained in power and processing speed as the onboard computer of the moving vehicle.In this project, we aim to introduce two methods of establishing communication between the cloud server and the vehicle computer, in order to send the input images from the vehicle to the cloud server and to send the processed images from the server back to the vehicle, where it can be used as input to further processing tasks. Moreover, in order to get insights on the practicality of our approaches, we also aim to benchmark the two approaches on different devices with variable parameters in the end.
